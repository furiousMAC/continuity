# Wireshark Dissectors for Apple's BLE Continuity Protocol

- [Updated Dissector for Curent Stable Release 3.4.4](./3.4.4)


### Latest Dissector Versions

Version [3.4.4](3.4.4) (Stable Release as of Mar 10, 2021) is currently the most up-to-date dissector for Apple's BLE Continuity Protocol. All of the changes since the initial Shmoocon release of the dissector can be seen in the [change log](CHANGELOG.md). All of the fields are also enumerated in the [fields](FIELDS.md) file. We currently do not have Windows installers for the newest set of changes.

### Older Dissector Versions.

Version [3.2.1](3.2.1) and Version [3.0.8](3.0.8) contain Windows installers, but are based off of the original dissector that we released at Shmoocon in January 2020. This means that all of the changes outlined in the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) have not been added to these versions and should not be used.
